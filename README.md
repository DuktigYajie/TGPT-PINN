# TGPT-PINN
Transformed Generative Pre-Trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (TGPT-PINN), a framework that extends Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and reduced basis methods (RBM) to the non- linear model reduction regime while maintaining the type of network structure and the unsupervised nature of its learning.
